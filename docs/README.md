Rainy - simple note syncing server for Tomboy
=============================================

(This documentation is best viewed through the [markdown.io renderer][this])

Introduction
------------

Rainy is a synchronization/cloud server intended for use with [Tomboy][tomboy] and other Tomboy-like clients (like [Tomdroid][tomdroid]). Although there exists [Snowy][snowy], Rainy is more lightweight and designed for smaller, private groups like friends and families. Rainy does not use a heavy SQL database as backend but a simple directory to store its notes and metadata.

### Facts:

  * written in C# and runs with [mono][mono] on all major platforms (could for example be hosted at a small home server or NAS, cheap VPS/cloud server, or even an a OpenWRT router)
  * re-uses the existing [tomboy-library][tomboylib], which is a C# library that should one day put in place into Tomboy, and could be used by other potential clients
  * uses the awesome [ServiceStack][servicestack] framework for providing the [Tomboy REST API][tomboyrest]
  * licensed under the free [GNU AGPLv3 license][agplv3]
